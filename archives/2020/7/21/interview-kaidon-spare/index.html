   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> hello! </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Would you like to start by introducing yourself? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Hello everyone! iâ€™m former President Kaidon Spare. Iâ€™m glad to be here! </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Are you enjoying your retirement so far? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> yep lol. Little boring so iâ€™m gonna start visiting D.C a few times a week to keep me busy. once we get my charity started iâ€™ll be busy with that. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Do you regret your resignation, or are you still glad that you resigned? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> a little of both. I feel like if i stayed i couldâ€™ve accomplished many things but i just had personal issues and i didnâ€™t wanna talk about them so i just thought the best choice was to resign but it wasnâ€™t. but because i did President Richardson will accomplish many great things and he has my full support for re-election if he accepts it. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> I noticed that you decided to move to Delaware, and, if I recall correctly, you moved there to be closer to the D.C. area: is there any particular reason why? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> well one iâ€™ve lived in florida all my life and itâ€™s way to hot lol second i want to experience D.C with my family and itâ€™s beautiful. I know every road and building in tampa so it gets boring after awhile. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Do you have any plans for restarting Spare's News Network? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> maybe. I will try to work something out with Mr Landers but i wanna do more research and get better at reporting and broadcasting before i get back into it. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> I believe you've said before that your brother is helping you make a website for your business, have you considered opening a site for SNN, or would you prefer to stay discord-only? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> a website would be a lot of work but i might make one. i would like to get our network to cover debates and moderate them as i have lots of experience moderating and participating in debates but i think a website could be something in the future. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Speaking of the future, what are your current plans? Do you intend on ever going back into politics? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> good question, i signed up to run for the open house position in seattle until the speaker decided to stay but i was only going to stay in the race if nobody else did it because i know we have limited people. hopefully in the future i will. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Fair enough. The following may still be a sensitive topic, so I won't ask much else: what are your thoughts regarding your recent ban? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> i think my actions were foolish and childish. I think the ban was good but i donâ€™t totally agree with nothing happening to the Speaker but i am happy he apologized and today i have been talking with my family and watching videos on how to keep my cool so this wonâ€™t happen again. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Alright. Before we wrap up, do you have any final thoughts you would like to share? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> i just want people to know this situation is being delt with to prevent it from happening again and i am learning from my mistakes. thanks for having me! </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Thanks for coming on, it was a pleasure talking with you ðŸ™‚</h4>
