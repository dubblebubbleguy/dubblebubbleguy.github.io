   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> @Senator Spencer Landers Would you like to start off by introducing yourself? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Sure Hi everyone Iâ€™m Senate Majority Leaders Spencer Landers and Iâ€™m doing an interview tonight </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> What are your thoughts on what happened today regarding Kaidon Spare, his ban as well as his pardoning? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Iâ€™m tired of him insulting people and making excuses. I heard he has one final chance then Heâ€™s done </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Fair enough. How do you think he did as president, and subsequently, as the anchor for Spare's News Network? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> I believe he didnâ€™t do a very good job as President because he wasnâ€™t proactive. He was constantly stacking Rep Elliotstone about impeachment in his media </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> As the anchor for Lander's News Network, how do you think your network compared to his? As a follow up, how do you think LNN compares to RWN? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Well I believe my news network not just focused on one topic, we covered many different things. I canâ€™t really compare myself to RWN because it is conservative and mine is more liberal. This means that we would report things more biased </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Fair enough. Moving on just a bit, how do you think tonight's senate session went? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> It went pretty well on my standards. We were able to pass all bills presented, and agreed on almost everything </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> I know it's getting late, so I'll let this be the final question. Do you have any future plans regarding legislation in the senate? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Yes in fact I do. I would like to pass legislation on climate change and different types of pollution including water and ground. I also want to legalize marijuana, pass a healthcare bill, and LGBTQ rights. That would just be the beginning </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> And do you have any final thoughts that you would like to share, regarding anything in particular? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Stay safe America. During these hard times I hope we can learn and grow as a country, United. Letâ€™s act like a real country instead of a clown show. Letâ€™s get things accomplished. Thanks for having me on tonight man </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> No problem, thanks for coming on, it was a pleasure talking with you ðŸ™‚</h4>
