   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Would you like to start by introducing yourself? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Hello I am the president of the United States, (Nicholas Richardson) I have come here tonight to have a interview with my VP/news anchor Dubble bubble. I feel alot has happened today and I want to bring a clear picture of what happened. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> I assume most of that would involve Kaidon, the executive order, and the recent senate session? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Indeed Very stressful day. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Alright. Do you have any preference as to where you would like to begin, or should we go in order of how the day went? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Just go in order </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> So what were your original thoughts regarding your executive order? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> My original thoughts was that this executive order would make the American people happy. I got to cocky and drew it up without looking into it. This has been the biggest mistake of my presidency. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Do you plan on retracting the executive order, or will you let it stand so that the supreme court can get some practice? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> I will let it stand. Although I do not support it anymore. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Alright. Moving on through the day, what are your thoughts regarding Kaidon Spare's recent ban? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> His ban came to a surprise at first but after looking into it I seen that he was causing more issues and doing what he did before. I understand he is going through a hard time but that doesn't give him the right to do what he did and I was blind to not see that he wouldn't change. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> What do you think about his even more recent pardon and re-invitation to the server? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> I don't know what to think of it. Maybe he will just do it again maybe he won't there is never a way to tell. I trusted kadion one to many times, I was his vice president during the most useless presidency I have ever seen and the shortest. I am done trusting kadion. Although I am not mad at him I am just disappointed in both myself and him. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Moving on just a bit more, what are your thoughts regarding tonight's senate session? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> During the Senate session I noticed they added amendments to me and rep. Franklins tax plan. Although I'm glad the Senate was active I don't fully support them adding onto it. I am willing to let it pass but I will just need more time to talk it over with our senators and understand why they are adding onto it. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> How do you feel about Senator Yanderson's amendment to the Minimum Wage Act? "An employer is not allowed to, in any way, hinder the minimum wage based on the employeeâ€™s gender." </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> I do not feel it is necessary. I believe it will change nothing as this is already law. Even then people will always break the law wages are changed on this subject but simply placing it on paper does not stop it. I feel like the administration could crack down on buissness that changes wage due to someone's gender but this amendment will not do it by itself. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Before we wrap up for the night, do you have any final thoughts that you would like to share? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Yes,I would like to once again ensure the American people I will not give up unlike former president Kadion. And anythough I have messed up I am willing to say and admitt that I have. Only a true leader will own up to there mistakes, I swear to you that I will make this right. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Fair enough. Thank you for your time, it was a pleasure talking with you tonight ðŸ™‚ </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> You aswell good night.</h4>
