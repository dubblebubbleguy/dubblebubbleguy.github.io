   <h3>Session</h3>
   <h3 class="container-date">July 20th - 9:30 PM EST</h3>  
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> @Senator session time! I will start off with attendance @Senator Spencer Landers Here @Senator Yanderson Ok... @Senator Drifters </h4>
   <h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span> Here </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> @Senator Yanderson He‚Äôs coming </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> Soy aqui. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Thanks everyone for being here tonight I‚Äôm glad that we can do all have a session. We will first start off with bills from the house. Their is currently only one. I will post it in here and let you all read it </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> Senator, how many members are currently in the Senate? </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> 4 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iCjcB5iCjrVfsBH4MRdaxnOFEhJbnzLsj_Fc5oKkeJQ/edit?usp=sharing">[Link shortened for readability]</a> Thumbs up when you have read it @Senator Drifters read it Ok any discussion or amendments? </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> I have a few points to make on this bill. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> I have an amendment to make as well You go first </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> First of all, I find it disturbing how a $10,000 annual income will be taxed 5%. That is below minimum wage, and that tax takes away an additional $500 yearly. What if a family needs that $500 for food, or for bills? I understand taxing the rich, but the poor are still disadvantaged by means of this bill. Kudos to whoever wrote it, though. It was exquisitely planned. Sort of. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> It was Spartacus </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> Senator Landers, would you like to propose your amendment? </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Yes @Senator Yanderson I would like to raise the corporate tax to 25 percent They have enough money they can spare more money </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> I agree to that. I will vote yes if you agree to my amendment, Senator. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Ok I will put it up for voting </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> I would like to lower taxes for $0-$10,000 households from 5% down to 1.5%. I am willing to give you reasoning, if you wish. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> 2 percent The house is more right then left </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> That shouldn‚Äôt matter when we‚Äôre talking about a humanitarian crisis, especially homelessness and the minimum wage. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Yes but we have to work together I‚Äôm not sure the house is willing to go that low. But we can try it </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> We can start off at 1.5%, but we can negotiate if the House demands it. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Hey I gotta take a shower real quick like 5 min and then I‚Äôll put it up for voting with the amendments </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> Okay. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> I‚Äôm back @Senator Yanderson </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> Okay. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Ok next order of business <a href=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/733174806257729657/733851090742804570/Minimum_Wage_Act.pdf>[Link shortened for readability]</a> Thumbs up when you have read it Ok any amendments? </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> Give me a moment to think of one. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Their doesn‚Äôt have to be one </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> I personally like the bill as-is, I‚Äôm just thinking of potential improvements. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Ok Take your time </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> Can we also include a section that would close the gender wage-gap? </h4>
   <h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span> Are you trying to make me hate this bill more </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Ok </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> Why would you hate a bill that fights inequality? Asking for a friend. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Just tell me the amendment </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> Amendment: An employer is not allowed to, in any way, hinder the minimum wage based on the employee‚Äôs gender. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Ok </h4>
   <h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span> I'm not going to get into pointless debate on gender pay or whatever but raising the federal minimum wage raises prices nationwide even in poor communities that get by with the current levels </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> Ok we will go vote on the amendment </h4>
   <h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span> I think that increase would help us tackle inflation. </h4>
   <h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span> That‚Äôs all I have SESSION ADJOURNED</h4>
