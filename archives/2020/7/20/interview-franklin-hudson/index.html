   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Hey Im ready </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Welcome So, just to confirm, you are the moderator that banned Kaidon Spare, correct? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Yes, that would be me. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Would you like to introduce yourself? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Well, my name is Franklin Hudson I am a moderator on this server and speaker of the house 2nd in line to the presidency after the vice president That is about it. I'm libertarian too, voted for kaidon in the election </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> That was actually going to be one of our first questions was whether you voted for Kaidon or not. Is there a particular reason that you voted for him? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> I wasn't very ideologically close to him But I recognized it was important for the conservatives to hold the white house, no matter if it was a left leaning republican or not it was still a step in the right direction. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Fair enough. Do you think he did a good job as president, for the short term that he had? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> No. He got no legislation through- he was very vague on his healthcare plans. And was always critical of other people. He only had one executive order signed which he quickly retracted and made no attempt to compromise with anyone. I would like to give an example. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> That was always something that struck odd with me as well. He praised me during the election for being a person that he could compromise with in office, yet I never saw that during his term. But let's hear your example </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> I asked kaidon about his tax policy for 1:00 P.M and I asked him his opinion on his tax plan I gave him 30 minutes and he didn't do anything I suggested something but he had no tax plan Later that day, I had an ambitious tax plan that I talked about with the VP Kaidon got so struck about my tax plan that he litterally freaking resigned The original plan was to have a 13% tax rate for everyone making under 1 million If anyone made above one million, all money taxed above 1 million would be taxed at 20% he insulted me about this plan, and than resigned That is the big example. </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> That was definitely an odd day. I do forget what happened after that, was he kicked or did he leave the server himself? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> He left himself But than he called me a "pussy boy" in my dms and got banned </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> What led to him getting unbanned? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> I do not know. He gave a- excuse my language crappy apology After spamming, well, the f word 5 times he came back and gave a 1 sentence apology and got unbanned by landers </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> After he came back, he started his own media outlet, Spare's News Network. What was your opinion regarding SNN, and do you think Kaidon did well in this position? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> SNN was a very low effort news site I always checked with landers news instead He put very little effort into it and made little unedited first draft stories on his notepad on his phone He wasn't too biased in his position you could definitely tell he was trying but he was still not doing a good job </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Do you think he will ever be unbanned, and if so, what would it take for him to be unbanned? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Right now- I don't think he will be ever unbanned Landers was very generous to unban him the first time but he has shown no signs of changing It would take maybe a multiple paragraph sincere edited apology for him to be unbanned </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> If he were to be unbanned, would you ever consider voting for him again? </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> I mean- If he were to be unbanned it would take a miracle of sorts and he would have to undergo a serious transformation but I do not think I would ever consider voting for him again </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-anchor">&#x25BA;</span> Alright, thank you for your time! It was a pleasure getting to talk with you ðŸ™‚ </h4>
   <h4><span class="rwn-guest">&#x25BA;</span> Thank you</h4>
