			<h3>Debate</h3>
			<h3 class="container-date">July 15th - 7:04 PM EST</h3>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>Welcome to the first presidential debate!
Please introduce yourselves and make your opening statements.</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>hi! my name is Kaidon Spare, republican nominee. I want to focus on getting vaccines for cancer, covid-19 and many other virus’s and diseases. I also focus on rebuilding the economy to create over 10,000,000 new jobs and get the 44,000,000 million lost from the corona virus back. I hope i can earn your vote because i’m the candidate who cares! Thank you and let’s get started!</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Good evening everyone, I am GodofPolitics, and I am your Democratic candidate for president of the United States. I am the candidate for you, not just for one party or one ideology, but for everyone. I am running an inclusive campaign focusing on the key issues affecting Americans most. Right now we are at a key point in the history of this great country, and it is up to us to pick a candidate that can serve the people by helping us recover from this pandemic and creating an economy that works for the many, and not just the few.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>Alright lets move onto the questions.
First Question.
What will you do in order to help the economy?
</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Well first we need to figure out how to safely reopen Small Businesses. They are the ones taking the biggest hits right now, not disney world who pays their ceo $60,000,000 a year. If we can get those businesses back open that will help a ton. I will also sign a executive order stating that you can’t be declined a job due to no college experience it will be all on skill and character. Another thing i will do let those students from other countries stay here so we won’t lose over 500,000 jobs. in the future i want to work will wallstreet to figure something out so people can’t sell their stocks as soon as a pandemic hits us so our market goes down. people do it all the time and we saw it during this pandemic.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>To help the economy we must focus on the working people, not the corporations and top 1% that control most of the wealth and power in this country. We will do this by investing in communities hit hard by this pandemic to make sure they have access to the facilities they need to get back on their feet, such as healthcare, education, and much more. In addition, we should cut taxes on the bottom 90% of this country because they are what makes up the backbone of this country, they are the consumers and they are important. This means however, that we should raise taxes on the top 1% to make sure they’re paying their fair share in taxes. By implementing this strategy we can be both fiscally responsible and provide the services people need to create a thriving economy that works for as many as possible.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>How do you see America on the global stage? Foreign Policy, War, Trade, etc.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>well in the previous debate i said we are getting walked on by other countries like a older brother on his younger sibling. We need to be tougher on other countries and pull troops out of dumb wars where we lose tons of money. On trade we need to start benefiting us rather then other countries. we must only do trade that helps us and that doesn’t cost us money. china will no longer take advantage of this country when i am president.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>The United States of America has been a large figure on the world stage, much of which is for the wrong reasons. We have made large mistakes on foreign policy, such as the invasion or Iraq. We cannot let these disastrous mistakes perpetuated by neocons to continue. As President, I would pull troops out of the Middle East in as quick as manner as realistically and safely possible. I would do the same in Europe. As for trade, we should encourage free trade with other countries in order to provide a better variety of products to consumers for lower prices. However, it must be fair trade, and with countries like China, it has not been fair trade. We must be tough on China, but not by implementing tariffs that have cost our country 300,000 jobs. I would fight for the American worker in a manner that is both tough on China, and protects the American worker as well.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What is your stance on the pro-life/pro-choice debate?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>I consider myself to be pro-choice, as I do not believe it is the governments job to tell women what they should be able to do with their own body. However, I believe after the first trimester it should be up to the states to decide what kinds of restrictions (if any) they would like to put on abortion at the will of the people. Overall, I consider myself to be pro-choice and I stand with Roe vs. Wade</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>i believe you should only have the option for 3 events. if you are between the age of 13-20, if you can’t financially support it or if you were raped. Other then that there is no reason you can’t have a baby.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What do you feel about social security? Do you favor increasing or reducing Social Security benefits? If so, how would you do it?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>I don’t think it should be increased. we have way to much debt and if you manage your money well you should be able to live off social security and a pension.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What about decreasing it? @Kaidon Spare For President</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>I recognize the drain that social security takes on both our budget and our tax dollars. However, I do not believe in drastically cutting it like many Republicans would. I would be in favor of slowly raising the age to 67 as long as it ensures that people already paying into the system would get their full benefits. I would also eliminate caps on high income earners on their payroll taxes for social security.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>i don’t think it should be decreased.
if we don’t raise it we will be fine.
like my opponent said raising it to 67 would help.
</h4>

			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What do you feel about social democratic programs such as free college and free healthcare?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>we can’t afford to give people like micheal bloomberg free healthcare. anyone making under $100,000 should get free healthcare, $100,000-$200,000 is only half and anything over that is regular price. that is for healthcare and college. Community college should be free.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>I am in favor of offering free public colleges to those making less than $100,000 because I understand the importance that education has in ensuring our children have the path and opportunity for success. However, I believe those in the higher incomes should be able to pay. As for healthcare, I believe that everyone should have access to healthcare at an affordable price, not for free. I am not in favor of proposals such as Medicare for All that would eliminate out of pocket expenses and private insurance. However, I am in favor of a public option that would ensure every American has access to healthcare at an affordable price.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>Do you not think it is controversial that a republican supports free college for those making under 100k?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>i’m more of a moderate republican.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>I would not say that
Free college is definitely on the other end of the spectrum.
 sorry for challenging you this isnt personal its just my job lmao 
</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>it’s not free for everyone. i don’t support gun control but i support better questioning and training. not all democrats support gun control but that doesn’t mean they aren’t a democrat.</h4>
			
			<h4><i>[A second moderator, LandersforPittsburghSenateLanders #7367, asks a question]</i> <span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>As I heard both of you say that you would work bipartisan, how would you accomplish getting both sides of the spectrum on the same side?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>when did i say that?
i’ve had a bipartisan campaign before in another server when i ran for governor and i think it would work well but i don’t agree with most democrats. most democrats wants free college and healthcare for everyone and they want to take guns. i want to work with democrats to get stuff passed that will work for the american people. we need to put politics aside and come together to make this country great.
</h4>

			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>I would get both sides of the spectrum on the same side because I offer plans that the vast majority of the American people support. Without influence from lobbyists and corporate money, we have an opportunity to implement policies that directly help the American people. And during these times of hardship, we have often come together as a country, despite our differences, to work towards a common goal of helping this country. And with my leadership and policy proposals, I believe I can reinvigorate that unity on main street and in D.C that feels lost at this current moment.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What do you have to say about immigration? Both perspectives on illegal and legal.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>we need immigrants but we need them here legally. we need to stop asking questions like what was george washington’s middle name and do better backround checks and make the process easier but better.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>I believe immigration is a very good think for this country. Some of the most successful companies, big and small, are founded by immigrants. Immigrants create jobs at a much higher rate than native born Americans, and are large contributers to this economy. I believe we be increasing the rates of immigrants coming into this country to ensure we maintain population growth and a stable economy. As for illegal immigration, they are unlawfully here, but I do not believe it should be policy to be going around to cities and rounding up immigrants to be deported, that is bad policy. We should be offering a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients but also making sure we can secure our border with proper, useful ways, not a wall.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What type of justices will you appoint to the supreme court?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>I would appoint justices to the supreme court that would interpret the rule of law in a fair way, but are also mindful of how our society has changed over the years, and how our perception of the law can change with it.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>i will appoint ones that are fair, well experienced and put politics aside. The justices we have on the supreme court don’t work for trump they work for the law. that’s the type we need in this server and i already have mine picked who have all of that.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What will you cut back on in the National Budget?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>i would like to pull troops out of wars we are losing lives and spending a ton of money on so i would cut the military budget and put that into investing into our education and middle class. i have some more budget cutting plans that will be coming out tonight.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>The number one thing that we should be cutting from our budget is defense spending. We currently spend $900 billion on defense, up 50% from just 3 years ago, this is unnecessary. I would cut $500 billion from defense to ensure we can have fiscal responsibility but also safety.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>how many more questions do u guys want</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>however many you have.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>Final Question
What will your policies do for the American people?
</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>well one of them is investing in the middle class, children’s education and by expanding healthcare for americans and making college free or affordable.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>My policies will directly help the American people that need the help the most. For years our politicians have been helping corporations and wall street, but not main street. This will end under my administration, as we will invest in the communities most deeply impacted by this pandemic and the modern day economy we live in.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>Thank you for the debate gentleman.
