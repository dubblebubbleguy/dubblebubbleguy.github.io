			<h3>Who am I?</h3>
			<h4>I'm a believer in the vision that our founding fathers outlined in the constitution: a small, restricted government within the full control of the people. I'm a believer in freedom of speech as well as freedom of the press. I'm a believer in equality of opportunity for all races, sexes and creeds. I'm a believer in freedom of religion, but also a separation of church and state; and I'm certain that any nation that doesn't follow these mentioned principles will surely fall to tyranny.</h4>

			<h4>As the election night continues, I'm happy to say that I may win the senate seat after all. At the time of writing, I have 7 votes to Cameron's 4, with 2 abstains. When I first found out I was running against Cameron, I wasn't particularly thrilled, as I knew that he was a popular candidate with a well prepared position. I had the same sinking feeling when I found out that Shawn was running.</h4>
			
			<h4>I had to begin strategizing for when I inevitably lost and would have to wait around for 2 weeks while everyone else got to partake in the politics, so I came up with the idea to turn this website into a full, right wing media network. Now that it appears I'll win the senate after all, I may hold off on doing that, or if I do, I'll do it in a more limited capacity. I will keep you all posted if I change my mind.</h4>
			
			<a href="images/election-night-1.png"><img src="images/election-night-1.png" alt=""></a>
			
			<h4>All in all, it's not surprising that the Kaidon / Nick ticket is winning, they were very popular and faced little to no resistance from GodofPolitics / Cameron. I'm happy to have backed them, and I hope they do well in leading our nation.</h4>
			
			<h4><i>Correction: at the time of writing it is now 7 votes to Cameron's 5 with 3 abstains. Also, Kaidon just officially won Pittsburgh and the presidency. Congratulations!</i></h4>

			<h3 class="container-title">Analysis of the 1st Presidental Debate</h3>
			<h3 class="container-date">July 16th</h3>
			
			<h4><i>This is my analysis of the 1st Presidental Debate between Kaidon Spare and GodofPolitics. I suggest you read the <a href="debate7-15-2020.html">text of the debate</a> first before reading my analysis.</i></h4>
			
			<h4>The opening statements start well enough, both candidates seem to have the same goal, reopening the economy and combating Covid-19, though while GodofPolitics leaves this as a vague goal, Kaidon gives a few more details as to his plan.</h4>
			
			<h4>The first question seems disastrous for the republican candidate, as, during his speech on how he would help the economy, he makes the promise that he’ll sign an executive order to remove college experience as a discriminatory factor in interviewing, citing that “it will be all on skill and character”. Later on in the debate, Kaidon will give his plan to make college free for lower and middle class citizens, which seems to go against this statement, as he will be devaluing college experience with this EO. I sincerely hope that Kaidon will walk back on this and reconsider his position. Meanwhile, GodofPolitics shares his promise to invest into communities and gives his plan to cut taxes for the bottom 90% of the country, something that I fully agree with him on, though instead of reducing spending to match, he plans on bumping up the 1%’s taxes to make up the difference.</h4>
			
			<h4>As we approach the question on foreign policy, both candidates seem to be somewhat patriotic in their responses, and they both give similar foreign policies that they would implement. While Kaidon claims that “china will no longer take advantage of this country”, GodofPolitics does go a step further and promises to try and preserve American jobs in the process, as he believes a hard break from China will hurt American workers. All in all, neither candidate did poorly here.</h4>
			
			<h4>The abortion question is where Kaidon starts to make a come back in this debate. GodofPolitics starts off with full support of Roe vs. Wade, citing “I do not believe it is the governments job to tell women what they should be able to do with their own body”, while Kaidon, despite several exceptions he gives, comes out much more pro-life than his opponent. </h4>
			
			<h4>The social security question is fine, both candidates do well on it.</h4>
			
			<h4>Now we approach the most important question in this debate, that being social programs. Kaidon comes out swinging with his strategy to give all Americans that makes less than 100K annual income free healthcare and college, with Americans between 100K – 200K annual income getting half of their costs covered for both. This is simply an unaffordable plan, and I do not see how this can be accomplished without sinking our economy. Again, I hope that Kaidon will walk back on this and consider compromising on this issue with his fellow republicans. Meanwhile, GodofPolitics comes out looking moderate on this question in comparison, as he sets a strategy to give out free college to all Americans with less than 100K annual income and then work on creating an affordable health care plan for every American.</h4>
			
			<h4>As far as bipartisan support goes, Kaidon denounces the Democrat position, but still hopes that both sides can come together to pass legislation, with GodofPolitics taking a very similar position.</h4>
			
			<h4>The immigration question helps bring the score back into the republican’s favor, as, while Kaidon simply states that legal immigration is welcome, GodofPolitics takes a step further to the left and puts immigrants on a pedestal, as well as giving his plan to “[offer] a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients” and to stop government agencies from searching for illegal immigrants to deport. I agree completely with Kaidon on this issue.</h4>
			
			<h4>The moderator then asks about Supreme Court picks, where GodofPolitics says that he would appoint justices that “would interpret the rule of law in a fair way” but goes on to say that our perception of the law should change as society changes, presumably referring to the perception of the constitution. If I am interpreting GodofPolitics' response correctly, then I am in great fear as to what his Supreme Court picks may do to our country. I am of the belief that the principles in the constitution should be upheld and very rarely (if ever) challenged, as they are the cornerstone of our nation. They should not be subject to whatever new wave our culture is on at the moment. Kaidon’s response is relatively dry in comparison, and he promises to appoint justices that are “fair, well experienced and put politics aside”.</h4>
			
			<h4>As we approach the end of the debate, we find ourselves at the national budget question. Both candidates promise to cut defense spending, which I am not in favor of. For our nation to be safe, it’s important that our army be so overwhelming that no one would even consider going to war with us. I don’t agree with raising the defense spending anytime soon, but it should not be lowered.</h4>
			
			<h4>As the debate is wrapped up, Kaidon reiterates his goal to invest in the middle class and make college and healthcare free or affordable, while GodofPolitics wishes to make policy to help main street, not wall street.</h4>
			
			<h4>After reading this debate, I wasn’t thrilled with either candidate, though I leaned in Kaidon’s camp. However, something I hadn’t considered at the time were the VP picks. It’s important to keep in mind, a vote for Kaidon or GodofPolitics is also a vote for Nicholas Richardson and Cameron Mills. While Cameron seems to be just as left as Kaidon and GodofPolitics, Nick appears to be a down to earth, moderate, right wing candidate. I haven’t talked with him much, but every time I have, he’s impressed me. With this in mind, I’m firmly in the Kaidon/Nick camp and I’ll be happy to vote for them on election day; and, while I look forward to tonight’s presidential debate, I find myself looking forward to the VP debate even more.</h4>

			<h3 class="container-title">Net Neutrality</h3>
			<h3 class="container-date">July 14th</h3>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<h4>On June 11th 2018, Net Neutrality was repealed by the Federal Communications Commission, which I believe was a massive mistake. I believe in the principle of Net Neutrality, <span><a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=431123081119072015116004025110105069016017050081065039090094006091123120086005107022107096017002029127037067005004127088021115060009044029035109087024005095112106029047077002122003088070074123019120091080004026093007013019066118029120091026126100088&EXT=pdf">which is best defined by this article,</a></span> "In general, net neutrality refers to a network design principle stating that all data packets should be treated equally regardless of their content, sites, and platforms", or in other words, your ISP should not be allowed to discriminate traffic based off of what kind of information you're sending or recieving, or where it's going to or coming from. I'm convinced that this principle is essential to keeping the internet free and allowing consumers and corporations alike to exchange information and conduct business freely over the internet.</h4>
				<h4>The problem posed by a lack of Net Neutrality is this: your ISP can choose to block any website you go to, block any type of traffic they don't like and can prioritize any traffic that they do like (slowing down all other traffic in the process). They can also choose to pressure users into spending more money by threatening to use any of the previously mentioned tactics. <span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/">This was the case during the California wildfires in 2018,</a></span> where Verizon throttled the Santa Clara fire department's "unlimited" data plan, slowing down their speeds, and then had the gall to ask the fire department for more money if they wanted the rate limiting to stop. Verizon's "unlimited" data plan only had a 25GB monthly threshold, at which point, Santa Clara FD had their speeds reduced to 1/200th of their previous speed, which, according to Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden, "severely interfered with the [fire department command vehicle's] ability to function effectively."</h4>
				<h4>Comcast is another example of why Net Neutrality is necessary for freedom on the internet.<span><a href="http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF">In 2001, a user on Comcast found that his VPN traffic was being blocked,</a></span> when he emailed Comcast and asked them what was going on, <span><a href="http://www.practicallynetworked.com/news/comcast.htm">he recieved this email as a response,</a></span> wherein, a Comcast representative stated that their data plan was "designated as a residential service and [did] not allow the use of commerical applications" and went on to recommend their @Home Professional plan if they wished to use VPN protocols, which was 95$ a month in 2001, almost 140$ a month in today's dollar. Then again in 2007, <span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/eff-tests-agree-ap-comcast-forging-packets-to-interfere">Comcast was found to be tampering with filesharing services by hijacking the user's connection and purposefully closing it.</a></span></h4>
				<h4>These are all violations of Net Neutrality and they impact the freedom of citizens on the internet. If freedom of speech is to be preserved in this modern era, it's crucial that the internet should remain open for all users.</h4>

			<h3 class="container-title">Healing Black America</h3>
			<h3 class="container-date">July 14th</h3>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<h4>While there are movements today claiming that police brutality is the most important issue facing black americans, I believe there is a much larger issue plaguing the black community that many movements are ignoring, that being the cycle of imprisonment spanning multiple generations. <span><a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/hidden-consequences-impact-incarceration-dependent-children">Based on an article from the National Institute of Justice, </a></span> "children whose parents are incarcerated are at higher risk for increased antisocial behaviors and psychological problems, such as depression", <span><a href="https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_race.jsp">and the current statistics from the Federal Bureau of Prisons</a></span> shows that, at the time of writing, in our federal prison system, 38.2% of our prison population is black, which is wildly out of proportion when you consider that <span><a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219">only 13.4% of Americans are black, according to national census data.</a></span></h4>
				<h4>So why is there a disproportionate amount of black americans in our prison system? <span><a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-43">If we look at the FBI crime statistics for 2017,</a></span> we find that, out of ~8.1 million arrests nation wide, ~2.2 million of those arrests were black people, meaning that 27.2% of all arrests in 2017 were black people, compared to their 13.4% make up in the general population. Looking at those same statistics, we also find that, out of 9,468 arrests for murder, 5,025 were black people, giving a whopping 53.1%, once again, compared to their general population make up of 13.4%</h4>
				<h4>So if black people are being arrested significantly more often than any other race, it indicates that they're committing more crimes, but why? I believe, based off of the facts I've presented above, that it all comes down to the cycle of imprisonment that may have started during the Jim Crow era. Black men have children, commit a crime and go to prison, and then their children have to grow up in a single parent home and are forced to deal with the trauma of having a parent in prison, which leads them to into a bad string of mental health issues that culminates in crime, and the cycle repeats</h4>
				<h4>So how can we heal black america? I think we can start by following the advice given by the National Institute of Justice and try to give as much visitation time as possible for children who have parents in prison, as well as expanding support across our federal system for children and parents who need to take days off to visit family members in prison. We can work on rehabiliating prisoners and we can help give them the resources necessary to find employment, education and therapy once they're released. We can expand federal and state prisons and start closing down private prisons: imprisonment is not a business and prisoners shouldn't be looked at as customers.</h4>
