			<h3>Who am I?</h3>
			<h4>I'm a believer in the vision that our founding fathers outlined in the constitution: a small, restricted government within the full control of the people. I'm a believer in freedom of speech as well as freedom of the press. I'm a believer in equality of opportunity for all races, sexes and creeds. I'm a believer in freedom of religion, but also a separation of church and state; and I'm certain that any nation that doesn't follow these mentioned principles will surely fall to tyranny.</h4>

			<h3 class="container-title">Net Neutrality</h3>
			<h3 class="container-date">June 14th</h3>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<h4>On June 11th 2018, Net Neutrality was repealed by the Federal Communications Commission, which I believe was a massive mistake. I believe in the principle of Net Neutrality, <span><a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=431123081119072015116004025110105069016017050081065039090094006091123120086005107022107096017002029127037067005004127088021115060009044029035109087024005095112106029047077002122003088070074123019120091080004026093007013019066118029120091026126100088&EXT=pdf">which is best defined by this article,</a></span> "In general, net neutrality refers to a network design principle stating that all data packets should be treated equally regardless of their content, sites, and platforms", or in other words, your ISP should not be allowed to discriminate traffic based off of what kind of information you're sending or recieving, or where it's going to or coming from. I'm convinced that this principle is essential to keeping the internet free and allowing consumers and corporations alike to exchange information and conduct business freely over the internet.</h4>
				<h4>The problem posed by a lack of Net Neutrality is this: your ISP can choose to block any website you go to, block any type of traffic they don't like and can prioritize any traffic that they do like (slowing down all other traffic in the process). They can also choose to pressure users into spending more money by threatening to use any of the previously mentioned tactics. <span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/">This was the case during the California wildfires in 2018,</a></span> where Verizon throttled the Santa Clara fire department's "unlimited" data plan, slowing down their speeds, and then had the gall to ask the fire department for more money if they wanted the rate limiting to stop. Verizon's "unlimited" data plan only had a 25GB monthly threshold, at which point, Santa Clara FD had their speeds reduced to 1/200th of their previous speed, which, according to Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden, "severely interfered with the [fire department command vehicle's] ability to function effectively."</h4>
				<h4>Comcast is another example of why Net Neutrality is necessary for freedom on the internet.<span><a href="http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF">In 2001, a user on Comcast found that his VPN traffic was being blocked,</a></span> when he emailed Comcast and asked them what was going on, <span><a href="http://www.practicallynetworked.com/news/comcast.htm">he recieved this email as a response,</a></span> wherein, a Comcast representative stated that their data plan was "designated as a residential service and [did] not allow the use of commerical applications" and went on to recommend their @Home Professional plan if they wished to use VPN protocols, which was 95$ a month in 2001, almost 140$ a month in today's dollar. Then again in 2007, <span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/eff-tests-agree-ap-comcast-forging-packets-to-interfere">Comcast was found to be tampering with filesharing services by hijacking the user's connection and purposefully closing it.</a></span></h4>
				<h4>These are all violations of Net Neutrality and they impact the freedom of citizens on the internet. If freedom of speech is to be preserved in this modern era, it's crucial that the internet should remain open for all users.</h4>

			<h3 class="container-title">Healing Black America</h3>
			<h3 class="container-date">June 14th</h3>
			<div class="paragraph">
				<h4>While there are movements today claiming that police brutality is the most important issue facing black americans, I believe there is a much larger issue plaguing the black community that many movements are ignoring, that being the cycle of imprisonment spanning multiple generations. <span><a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/hidden-consequences-impact-incarceration-dependent-children">Based on an article from the National Institute of Justice, </a></span> "children whose parents are incarcerated are at higher risk for increased antisocial behaviors and psychological problems, such as depression", <span><a href="https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_race.jsp">and the current statistics from the Federal Bureau of Prisons</a></span> shows that, at the time of writing, in our federal prison system, 38.2% of our prison population is black, which is wildly out of proportion when you consider that <span><a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219">only 13.4% of Americans are black, according to national census data.</a></span></h4>
				<h4>So why is there a disproportionate amount of black americans in our prison system? <span><a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-43">If we look at the FBI crime statistics for 2017,</a></span> we find that, out of ~8.1 million arrests nation wide, ~2.2 million of those arrests were black people, meaning that 27.2% of all arrests in 2017 were black people, compared to their 13.4% make up in the general population. Looking at those same statistics, we also find that, out of 9,468 arrests for murder, 5,025 were black people, giving a whopping 53.1%, once again, compared to their general population make up of 13.4%</h4>
				<h4>So if black people are being arrested significantly more often than any other race, it indicates that they're committing more crimes, but why? I believe, based off of the facts I've presented above, that it all comes down to the cycle of imprisonment that may have started during the Jim Crow era. Black men have children, commit a crime and go to prison, and then their children have to grow up in a single parent home and are forced to deal with the trauma of having a parent in prison, which leads them to into a bad string of mental health issues that culminates in crime, and the cycle repeats</h4>
				<h4>So how can we heal black america? I think we can start by following the advice given by the National Institute of Justice and try to give as much visitation time as possible for children who have parents in prison, as well as expanding support across our federal system for children and parents who need to take days off to visit family members in prison. We can work on rehabiliating prisoners and we can help give them the resources necessary to find employment, education and therapy once they're released. We can expand federal and state prisons and start closing down private prisons: imprisonment is not a business and prisoners shouldn't be looked at as customers.</h4>
