			<h3>Debate</h3>
			<h3 class="container-date">July 16th - 7:16 PM EST</h3>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>I'm ready</h4>

			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>Is there anything you disagree with your running mate on?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Okay, I completely agree with his trade plane and standing stronger than other adminstrations on trade. On the healthcare I don't believe it should be free although he has stated that he isn't looking for a full free system.

So not really.
Next question?</h4>

			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>Are you in a fit capacity to lead if something were to happen to the presidnet of the united states?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>I am, if I am to take the position of president which I hope I won't have to, I will continue to do as my running mate intended.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What is your policies on foreign policy?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>On forign policy I want to push for trade with nation's the United States can trust I want to eliminate trade that hurts us or doesn't benifit us.
And I want to build newer trade relations with nation's that can benifit us.</h4>

			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What is your policy on immigration?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>On immigration I want to make a better and easier way to become citizen and as my partner has stated before get rid of useless questions on the citizenship test. But I will never stand for Breaking into our nation illigaly.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What will you do as the vice president?
For example,
will you posistion yourself like walter mondale?</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>As vice president I will push for better citizenship application bills to reach the presidents desk. I want to ensure that corruption is not a problem in Congress and or the the executive branch and want to address it as much as possible.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>good good
What do you plan to do about healthcare?</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Alright on healthcare I will be helping the president set up a new healthcare system that can be cheaper and more benificial for the lower classes of the US population. I don't believe this will be needed for the rich and will focus on low costing healthcare on the lower class.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What will you be cutting on in the national budget?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>On the national budget I believe we should cut funding on things like doca and a little from the military budget but I want to address that this spending will help veterans in the out come and will also help the lower class.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>If I do not call correctly you ran against kaidon
in the republican primary
what has caused you two to become running mates
after your competetion?</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>He was never a enemy of mine and if you remember during those debates there really wasn't any attacks.
We work good together and can come to conclusions if we disagree and it's a good team to be in when we can achieve things like this.</h4>

			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What do you hate the most about your opponents?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>I don't really hate anything about my opponents but I disagree with there lak of activity on this race, and there main issues want to undermine the economy by sending free money to the population and giving free health care and collage. Which isn't really even free because tax would be skyrocketing to keep us afloat.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What do you think it says about @Cameron Mills for President if he doesn't show up to the single debate he has agreed to go to?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>I believe it is disappointing and honestly if you want to be in this position of power you have to be active. If he doesn't show up now how will we know if he will even be active in office? How would we know if anything would get done. I have shown up for everything my running mate has held public and I have gone to everything I promised to be at think about that when you vote. Also if he can't keep this promise he probably won't keep any if elected.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>Alright.
What is your stance on the pro-life/pro-choice debate?</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>On this I believe It can be exceptible in some cases but in most is unessary. Rap and if the birth could cause medical problems I think should be allowed for abortion (at the early stages)

I am strongly against late term abortion plus I believe we should teach kids more sex Ed and safe sex education to help educate them on it because a kid is going to have sex it's just apart of life. But if they can't do it safe they could end up with pregnancy and they need to be dedicated on it properly.</h4>

			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>What do you feel about social security? Do you favor increasing or reducing Social Security benefits? If so, how would you do it?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>I believe that we should have stronger social security for elderly and medically disabled and focus less on giving away stuff. What we need to add to it is helping people find jobs and we can do this by setting up a system were people can call or meet up with the agents and get job benifits. And more job opportunitys. Anything else?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>How close would you say you are idealogically to your running mate On a scale of 1-100
100 being we are basically the same person because we share so many beliefs 0 is I am litterally exactly the opposite of you
on every issue</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>I would say around 70</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="moderator">&#x25BA;</span>ok
thats it for today gentleman</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>It was a pleasure to be here</h4>
			
			<h3 class="container-date">The debate ends at 8:02 EST, giving a total time of 46 minutes.</h3>
