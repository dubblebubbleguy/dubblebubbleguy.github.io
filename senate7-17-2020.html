			<h3>Session</h3>
			<h3 class="container-date">July 17th - 1:11 PM EST</h3>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>@Senator it‚Äôs session time!
I will take roll in a minute
Ok @Senator Alejandro Landers(D,RI)
‚ÄúHere‚Äù
@Senator Drifters</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Here</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>@Senator Dubblebubble</h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>Here</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>@Senator Dennis Edwards
I do t think he‚Äôs here for today
Anyways their should always be 3/4 people to have a session
Ok we should vote on Senate speaker, senate majority and minority leader
I would like to be speaker</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Ok</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Does anyone else wanna run for speaker?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>No.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Ok then I guess I‚Äôm the senate speaker like Mitch
What about majority or minority leader?
Honestly I don‚Äôt believe we have enough people for that yet so let‚Äôs not have them until midterms
Or later date</h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>The majority leader is going to have to be Republican. As far as the minority leader, I guess either Democrat or Libertarian</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>We only have 4 senators so I believe we should wait
What do you all think?</h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>Wait, hold up, the 4th senator is Independent</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Sure</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>yeah we can't have majority or minority leaders, we're all a different party.</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Oof</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Well I‚Äôm the ‚Äúmajority leader‚Äù since i have to do sessions
Ok moving on
What are your schedules like? What are the best times and days you all can meet?</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Mostly open here</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Ok we don‚Äôt have to meet too often probably around 2-3 times a week
Would it work better at night, afternoon or morning?</h4>

			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Afternoons probably</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>Night would be preferable</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Ok</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Oh not too late tho how late about</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Latest would be like 9</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>That's fine</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Ok :thumbsup:. I will make a schedule today and show you guys and we can make tweaks and changes if needed
please use this template while drafting bill ,
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W92PjYdTYeQILBFFKxYea6_9zVDGWtBVSO73_ErqMag/edit?usp=sharing">[Link shortened for readability]</a> , This is the template you will use to write a bill
Don‚Äôt feel like you have to be perfect because I‚Äôm not that good either
All the bills you propose will go to #propose-legislation and then we will vote on it in session. We can also make amendments to a bill if needed</h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>Our last senator is about to join us
he just needs to be roled #sworn-in</h4>

			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Ok</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>What's our next order of business?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>We don‚Äôt have any bills yet
Um
Do t forget you have your offices. That‚Äôs where you can make announcements
And other stuff
We will also vote on things that come from the house and president</h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>Masks should be determined by the states, counties and cities
It's unreasonable to demand that a rural town with a couple dozen people, all uninfected, should be forced to wear masks because of a national order</h4>

			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Here the thing
They could be a symptomatic
But I agree that it‚Äôs up to the states
I support mask mandates for individual states but not the whole country</h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>Not if they sheltered in place like they were asked to do several months ago
Some cities may need it, but not every city and town across the nation</h4>

			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>But those rural people who listen to trump probably weren‚Äôt quarantined</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>Excuse me?</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Some of them</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>Some of them
not all of them</h4>

			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>I didn‚Äôt say all of them</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>So don't punish all of them for the actions of some of them</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>I never said all I said some
Not all trump supporters are bad</h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>let the individual states, counties and cities determine what's best given their individual circumstances</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Well in the rp we only have states</h4>
			
			<h4><i>At this point, a moderator steps in to the session and joins the conversation, but his messages were removed and are unaccessable now</i></h4>
			
			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>So let the individual states, counties and cities determine what's best for them</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>@Franklin Hudson I know your a mod but this is the senate floor for senators only
Talk in general chat
Here are some ideas for bills you can work on. 
Climate change
Healthcare 
Coronavirus 
Economy
LGBTQ+
Trades
Racial Inequality</h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>Free speech, net neutrality and internet encryption are bill topics that I plan on working on</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>@Senator we have to approve the Cabinet</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span>Okay</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="republican">&#x25BA;</span>Ok</h4>
			
			<h4><i>The Cabinet approval vote for Jordan McGraw as Secretary of Education recieves 3 ayes and 1 abstain</i></h4>
			
			<h4><i>The Supreme Court approval vote for Bob Young recieves 3 ayes and 1 abstain</i></h4>
			
			<h4><i>The Cabinet approval vote for Oes as Secretary of State recieves 4 ayes</i></h4>
			
			<h4><i>The Cabinet approval vote for Shawn Cochran as Secretary of Defense recieves 3 ayes and 1 abstain</i></h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>That is everything we have to approve for now
@Senator Dennis Edwards tell me when a good time is for you to have a session</h4>

			<h4><span class="independent">&#x25BA;</span>Just @ me when you want to have one</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Ok
Tomorrow is probably the next one
Ok how does tomorrow at 6:30pm sound?
@Senator Drifters @Senator Dubblebubble</h4>

			<h4><i>Session schedule vote is held and recieves 3 ayes with 1 nay</i></h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>This will not work, I have plans that evening</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>We will still go on if we have have 3/4
Oh sorry
Ok 6:30 it is</h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>Unless you're alright with holding off until I can send my vote in a few hours later</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>And you can always vote
Yeah voting is open for 24 hours
For bills</h4>

			<h4><span class="libertarian">&#x25BA;</span>I don't mind missing the debates, just so long as I can still vote</h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Yeah some bills may be passed but you can still vote on them
Ok so 6:30pm it is tomorrow
Motion to adjourn the session until further notice</h4>

			<h4><i>Session adjournment vote is held and recieves 4 ayes</i></h4>
			
			<h4><span class="democrat">&#x25BA;</span>Session Adjourned</h4>
			
			<h3 class="container-date">The session ends at 1:59 PM EST, giving a total time of 48 minutes.</h3>
