			<h3 class="container-title">Kaidon Spare Picked for Secretary of Defense</h3>

			<h4>At 5:19PM EST today, President Nicholas Richardson confirmed that he would be appointing Kaidon Spare as his Secretary of Defense. This is coming off of a day long vote and discussion with his cabinet members and Vice President.</h4>
			
			<h4>Kaidon Spare recently resigned as president after a heated argument with two other government officials. When asked as to why he resigned, he replied "i resigned because i’m not dealing with congressmen drive tanks down the street and kill people.. a president shouldn’t have to deal with that." Kaidon also went on to say that he never actually wanted to be president, "i did it for fun because i didn’t think i would win".</h4>

			<h4>After resigning as president, he started the Spare's News Network, of which he is the main anchor, though he has also expressed interest in running for the Atlanta senate. As to why he wants to re-enter politics, he has not said. I predict that he will be confirmed by the senate with no trouble, although the next senate session date is still up in the air. President Nicholas Richardson will also be holding a press conference at 6PM EST today, where it is likely he will speak more on Kaidon's appointment.</h4>
