			<h4>At 6:36PM EST today, after getting into yet another heated argument, Kaidon Spare was banned from the discord server. This was just 77 minutes after he was confirmed by President Nicholas Richardson as the new Secretary of Defense. In Nicholas Richardson's 6PM press briefing, when asked why he chose Kaidon Spare for SoD, the president answered: "He was the only person who told me they would take the position no one else asked. If there was more I would have had my administration pick who they wanted."</h4>

			<h4>During a discussion on whether President Nicholas Richardson's latest executive order, setting the minimum drinking age to 18 nation wide, was constitutional, Kaidon Spare interjected multiple times, with statements such as "You guys are always complaining about something" and "There is no roleplay in #general, so anything you guys say in here doesn't matter, that's why offices are open". After being challenged, specifically by Franklin Hudson, Kaidon Spare went on to file a formal complain to the Supreme Court to remove Franklin Hudson's powers as a moderator. He was then banned from the server.</h4>

			<h4>After his ban, Franklin Hudson shared the harassing messages that Kaidon Spare had been sending him for the past few days. He joked that he had accidently banned Kaidon, until he doubled down on his decision with the following: "jk hes banned i did it purposefully and i dont regret it". President Nicholas Richardson followed up with "Im done defending him dear lord I admitted to messing up and he had to stretch it out saying I didn't do anything."</h4>

			<h4>All of Kaidon Spare's recent messages in the discord were deleted when he was banned, including Spare's News Network. After his ban, Kaidon went to Franklin's DMs to further harass him and threaten him with the removal of his power. As of now, Landers has not given a position on whether Kaidon will be unbanned or not. Unfortunately, President Nicholas Richardson will be forced to find a new Secretary of Defense.
