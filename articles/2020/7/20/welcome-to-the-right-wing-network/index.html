			<h4><a href="../../../../../archives/2020/7/19/house-session-speaker-franklin-hudson/index.html">In the House session on July 19th</a>, Atlanta Representative Harold Elliotsone made the following comment regarding our President Nicholas Richardson, "I don’t like Nicholas Let’s Impeach him". When prompted for a reason by the Speaker of the House Franklin Hudson, Harold went on to say "We do [have a reason]. Treason. .. Just do it, .. do it please I beg you." Ultimately, this came to nothing, and the House went on to another topic of discussion.</h4>
			
			<h4>Unfortunately, this comment took Landers News Network and Spares News Network by storm, taking up a majority of their media coverage on July 19th and July 20th. I counted over 7 mentions of the impeachment comment in their news coverage, with SNN's nightly news segment going as far to claim as "He [Harold] has started a impeachment trial on new President Nick Richardson".</h4>
			
			<h4>Harold Elliotsone has <i>not</i> started an impeachment trial against our president, nor does it appear that he has any serious intention of doing so. He made one comment in one session, and it has been blown out of proportion on every other network. When confronted with this, former president and current anchor of SNN Kaidon Spare replied "now if you don’t like it oh well".</h4>
			
			<h4>Long time readers of this website will know that <a href="../../../../../articles/2020/7/16/election-night/index.html">I have been planning on starting a media network for awhile now</a>, and I believe that now is the right time, hence the rebranding of the site. We will be covering more current events than before, and I will be inviting writers to join our team and help contribute to our news cycle. I will still be writing some opinion pieces, tracking my campaign progress, and archiving any debates or sessions that are held, none of that will change.
