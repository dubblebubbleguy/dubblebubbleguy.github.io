			<h4>While there are movements today claiming that police brutality is the most important issue facing black americans, I believe there is a much larger issue plaguing the black community that many movements are ignoring, that being the cycle of imprisonment spanning multiple generations. <span><a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/topics/articles/hidden-consequences-impact-incarceration-dependent-children">Based on an article from the National Institute of Justice, </a></span> "children whose parents are incarcerated are at higher risk for increased antisocial behaviors and psychological problems, such as depression", <span><a href="https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_race.jsp">and the current statistics from the Federal Bureau of Prisons</a></span> shows that, at the time of writing, in our federal prison system, 38.2% of our prison population is black, which is wildly out of proportion when you consider that <span><a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045219">only 13.4% of Americans are black, according to national census data.</a></span></h4>
			<h4>So why is there a disproportionate amount of black americans in our prison system? <span><a href="https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-43">If we look at the FBI crime statistics for 2017,</a></span> we find that, out of ~8.1 million arrests nation wide, ~2.2 million of those arrests were black people, meaning that 27.2% of all arrests in 2017 were black people, compared to their 13.4% make up in the general population. Looking at those same statistics, we also find that, out of 9,468 arrests for murder, 5,025 were black people, giving a whopping 53.1%, once again, compared to their general population make up of 13.4%</h4>
			<h4>So if black people are being arrested significantly more often than any other race, it indicates that they're committing more crimes, but why? I believe, based off of the facts I've presented above, that it all comes down to the cycle of imprisonment that may have started during the Jim Crow era. Black men have children, commit a crime and go to prison, and then their children have to grow up in a single parent home and are forced to deal with the trauma of having a parent in prison, which leads them to into a bad string of mental health issues that culminates in crime, and the cycle repeats</h4>
			<h4>So how can we heal black america? I think we can start by following the advice given by the National Institute of Justice and try to give as much visitation time as possible for children who have parents in prison, as well as expanding support across our federal system for children and parents who need to take days off to visit family members in prison. We can work on rehabiliating prisoners and we can help give them the resources necessary to find employment, education and therapy once they're released. We can expand federal and state prisons and start closing down private prisons: imprisonment is not a business and prisoners shouldn't be looked at as customers.</h4>
