			<h4>On June 11th 2018, Net Neutrality was repealed by the Federal Communications Commission, which I believe was a massive mistake. I believe in the principle of Net Neutrality, <span><a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=431123081119072015116004025110105069016017050081065039090094006091123120086005107022107096017002029127037067005004127088021115060009044029035109087024005095112106029047077002122003088070074123019120091080004026093007013019066118029120091026126100088&EXT=pdf">which is best defined by this article,</a></span> "In general, net neutrality refers to a network design principle stating that all data packets should be treated equally regardless of their content, sites, and platforms", or in other words, your ISP should not be allowed to discriminate traffic based off of what kind of information you're sending or recieving, or where it's going to or coming from. I'm convinced that this principle is essential to keeping the internet free and allowing consumers and corporations alike to exchange information and conduct business freely over the internet.</h4>
			<h4>The problem posed by a lack of Net Neutrality is this: your ISP can choose to block any website you go to, block any type of traffic they don't like and can prioritize any traffic that they do like (slowing down all other traffic in the process). They can also choose to pressure users into spending more money by threatening to use any of the previously mentioned tactics. <span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/verizon-throttled-fire-departments-unlimited-data-during-calif-wildfire/">This was the case during the California wildfires in 2018,</a></span> where Verizon throttled the Santa Clara fire department's "unlimited" data plan, slowing down their speeds, and then had the gall to ask the fire department for more money if they wanted the rate limiting to stop. Verizon's "unlimited" data plan only had a 25GB monthly threshold, at which point, Santa Clara FD had their speeds reduced to 1/200th of their previous speed, which, according to Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden, "severely interfered with the [fire department command vehicle's] ability to function effectively."</h4>
			<h4>Comcast is another example of why Net Neutrality is necessary for freedom on the internet.<span><a href="http://www.jthtl.org/content/articles/V2I1/JTHTLv2i1_Wu.PDF">In 2001, a user on Comcast found that his VPN traffic was being blocked,</a></span> when he emailed Comcast and asked them what was going on, <span><a href="http://www.practicallynetworked.com/news/comcast.htm">he recieved this email as a response,</a></span> wherein, a Comcast representative stated that their data plan was "designated as a residential service and [did] not allow the use of commerical applications" and went on to recommend their @Home Professional plan if they wished to use VPN protocols, which was 95$ a month in 2001, almost 140$ a month in today's dollar. Then again in 2007, <span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/eff-tests-agree-ap-comcast-forging-packets-to-interfere">Comcast was found to be tampering with filesharing services by hijacking the user's connection and purposefully closing it.</a></span></h4>
			<h4>These are all violations of Net Neutrality and they impact the freedom of citizens on the internet. If freedom of speech is to be preserved in this modern era, it's crucial that the internet should remain open for all users.</h4>
