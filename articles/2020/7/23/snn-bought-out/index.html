			<h4>Yesterday at 9:47 PM EST, Spare's News Network was officially bought out by the Right Wing Network for 500$. SNN is now a subsidiary network of RWN, and we have no intention of shutting down SNN. Kaidon Spare, the owner of SNN, has also joined the Right Wing Network as a journalist.</h4>

			<h4>This buyout brings our media competition down to just Lander's News Network, which is currently a subscriber only network. All free media in Lander's United States is now under the RWN umbrella. As the network manager of RWN, I intend to take my responsibility seriously and to strive even more to bring accurate and comprehensive articles to our readers. I wish the best of luck to our two new journalists, Nicholas Richardson and Kaidon Spare, and I hope that they will be a valuable addition to our network.</h4>
			
			<h4>As always, if you would like to support the Right Wing Network, consider renting ad space! It helps support our network and our journalists, and it ensures that our content may remain free in the future. <a href="../../../../../rent-an-ad.html">Click here for more info.</a></h4>
