			<h4>Yesterday, July 22 2021, the Mississippi River had an oil spill. This situation was a serious issue for the Richardson Administration. The worry was that the oil would flow to the Gulf and cause more issues, the Richardson Administration had to act fast.</h4>
			
			<h4>Right off the bat, President Nicholas Richardson left a press conference to deal with the situation and used his powers as commander and chief by sending the National Guard and coast guard to pump it out of the river and close the river down.</h4>
			
			<h4>As of today, both the National guard and coast guard are working together to get the river pumped clean, and you can rest assured that the situation is not going out of hand.</h4>
