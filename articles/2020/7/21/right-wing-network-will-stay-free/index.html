			<h4>Earlier today, Spencer Landers, owner of the server, and Franklin Hudson, moderator of the server, announced that we will now be roleplaying with money and that media outlets can start subscription services. They also announced that media outlets will now be paying corporate tax. Spare's News Network and Lander's News Network have already committed to a subscription service, with LNN costing 450 a week and SNN costing 2,800 a week respectively at the time of writing.</h4>
			
			<h4>The Right Wing Network has no intention of moving to a subscription service at this time. We are committed to keeping freedom of speech alive and ensuring that everyone has access to our site. We will however be implementing advertisements, but they are entirely user run, no advertisements from the outside world will ever be run on this site. If you are interested in advertising on RWN, <a href="../../../../../rent-an-add.html">please click here.</a></h4>
			
			<h4>We will be keeping a close eye on SNN and LNN and we will let you know if there are any updates to their business model.</h4>
