			<h4><a href="../../../../../articles/2020/7/20/kaidon-spare-banned/index.html">Following Kaidon Spare's ban yesterday,</a> Kaidon Spare has now been unbanned. This was done at around midnight today, with Kaidon Spare giving a formal apology at 12:20 AM. In his apology, he makes it clear that what he did was "awful, immature and childish" and he promises that he will "focus on getting myself under control".</h4>

			<h4>Franklin Hudson, the moderator who banned Kaidon Spare, accepted Kaidon's apology and also apologized himself for overreacting. <a href="../../../../../archives/2020/7/20/interview-franklin-hudson/index.html">This is following Franklin Hudson's interview with RWN</a> where he stated "I don't think he will be ever unbanned Landers was very generous to unban him the first time but he has shown no signs of changing."</h4>

			<h4><a href="../../../../../archives/2020/7/20/interview-nicholas-richardson/index.html">In an interview held with President Nicholas Richardson after Kaidon Spare's unbanning,</a> Nick had the following to say: " I don't know what to think of it. Maybe he will just do it again maybe he won't there is never a way to tell. I trusted kadion one to many times, I was his vice president during the most useless presidency I have ever seen and the shortest. I am done trusting kadion. Although I am not mad at him I am just disappointed in both myself and him", <a href="../../../../../archives/2020/7/20/interview-spencer-landers/index.html">and in an interview just a few minutes afterwards with Senator Spencer Landers,</a> owner of the server, Landers had the following to say about Kaidon: "I’m tired of him insulting people and making excuses. I heard he has one final chance then He’s done."</h4>
			
			<h4><a href="../../../../../archives/2020/7/21/interview-kaidon-spare/index.html">Surprisingly, Kaidon Spare agreed to be interviewed by RWN today.</a> In this interview, when asked about the whole situation, he had the following to say: "i think my actions were foolish and childish. I think the ban was good but i don’t totally agree with nothing happening to the Speaker but i am happy he apologized and today i have been talking with my family and watching videos on how to keep my cool so this won’t happen again."</h4>
			
			<h4>Whether Kaidon Spare will go on to have a friendly career in the server, or if he will be banned again, is still up in the air. The Right Wing Network will not be making any predictions at this time.</h4>
