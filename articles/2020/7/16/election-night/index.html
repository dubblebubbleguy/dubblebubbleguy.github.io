			<h4>As the election night continues, I'm happy to say that I may win the senate seat after all. At the time of writing, I have 7 votes to Cameron's 4, with 2 abstains. When I first found out I was running against Cameron, I wasn't particularly thrilled, as I knew that he was a popular candidate with a well prepared position. I had the same sinking feeling when I found out that Shawn was running.</h4>
			
			<h4>I had to begin strategizing for when I inevitably lost and would have to wait around for 2 weeks while everyone else got to partake in the politics, so I came up with the idea to turn this website into a full, right wing media network. Now that it appears I'll win the senate after all, I may hold off on doing that, or if I do, I'll do it in a more limited capacity. I will keep you all posted if I change my mind.</h4>

			<h4>All in all, it's not surprising that the Kaidon / Nick ticket is winning, they were very popular and faced little to no resistance from GodofPolitics / Cameron. I'm happy to have backed them, and I hope they do well in leading our nation.</h4>
			
			<h4><i>Correction: at the time of writing it is now 7 votes to Cameron's 5 with 3 abstains. Also, Kaidon just officially won Pittsburgh and the presidency. Congratulations!</i></h4>
			
			<h4><i>Correction: Sorry, more corrections coming out as new information comes in: it is now 8 votes to Cameron's 5, and Kaidon did NOT win Pittsburgh, but he won Seattle and still won the presidency.</i></h4>
		
			<h4><i>Update: I am pleased to announce that my opponent has resigned. Thank you to everyone who voted for me, I'm glad that I can serve as the senator for Seattle ðŸ’™</i></h4>
