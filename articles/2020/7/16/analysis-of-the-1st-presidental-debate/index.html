			<h4><i>This is my analysis of the 1st Presidental Debate between Kaidon Spare and GodofPolitics. I suggest you read the <a href="../../../../../archives/2020/7/15/kaidon-spare-and-god-of-politics-presidential-debate/index.html">text of the debate</a> first before reading my analysis.</i></h4>
			
			<h4>The opening statements start well enough, both candidates seem to have the same goal, reopening the economy and combating Covid-19, though while GodofPolitics leaves this as a vague goal, Kaidon gives a few more details as to his plan.</h4>
			
			<h4>The first question seems disastrous for the republican candidate, as, during his speech on how he would help the economy, he makes the promise that he’ll sign an executive order to remove college experience as a discriminatory factor in interviewing, citing that “it will be all on skill and character”. Later on in the debate, Kaidon will give his plan to make college free for lower and middle class citizens, which seems to go against this statement, as he will be devaluing college experience with this EO. I sincerely hope that Kaidon will walk back on this and reconsider his position. Meanwhile, GodofPolitics shares his promise to invest into communities and gives his plan to cut taxes for the bottom 90% of the country, something that I fully agree with him on, though instead of reducing spending to match, he plans on bumping up the 1%’s taxes to make up the difference.</h4>
			
			<h4>As we approach the question on foreign policy, both candidates seem to be somewhat patriotic in their responses, and they both give similar foreign policies that they would implement. While Kaidon claims that “china will no longer take advantage of this country”, GodofPolitics does go a step further and promises to try and preserve American jobs in the process, as he believes a hard break from China will hurt American workers. All in all, neither candidate did poorly here.</h4>
			
			<h4>The abortion question is where Kaidon starts to make a come back in this debate. GodofPolitics starts off with full support of Roe vs. Wade, citing “I do not believe it is the governments job to tell women what they should be able to do with their own body”, while Kaidon, despite several exceptions he gives, comes out much more pro-life than his opponent. </h4>
			
			<h4>The social security question is fine, both candidates do well on it.</h4>
			
			<h4>Now we approach the most important question in this debate, that being social programs. Kaidon comes out swinging with his strategy to give all Americans that makes less than 100K annual income free healthcare and college, with Americans between 100K – 200K annual income getting half of their costs covered for both. This is simply an unaffordable plan, and I do not see how this can be accomplished without sinking our economy. Again, I hope that Kaidon will walk back on this and consider compromising on this issue with his fellow republicans. Meanwhile, GodofPolitics comes out looking moderate on this question in comparison, as he sets a strategy to give out free college to all Americans with less than 100K annual income and then work on creating an affordable health care plan for every American.</h4>
			
			<h4>As far as bipartisan support goes, Kaidon denounces the Democrat position, but still hopes that both sides can come together to pass legislation, with GodofPolitics taking a very similar position.</h4>
			
			<h4>The immigration question helps bring the score back into the republican’s favor, as, while Kaidon simply states that legal immigration is welcome, GodofPolitics takes a step further to the left and puts immigrants on a pedestal, as well as giving his plan to “[offer] a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients” and to stop government agencies from searching for illegal immigrants to deport. I agree completely with Kaidon on this issue.</h4>
			
			<h4>The moderator then asks about Supreme Court picks, where GodofPolitics says that he would appoint justices that “would interpret the rule of law in a fair way” but goes on to say that our perception of the law should change as society changes, presumably referring to the perception of the constitution. If I am interpreting GodofPolitics' response correctly, then I am in great fear as to what his Supreme Court picks may do to our country. I am of the belief that the principles in the constitution should be upheld and very rarely (if ever) challenged, as they are the cornerstone of our nation. They should not be subject to whatever new wave our culture is on at the moment. Kaidon’s response is relatively dry in comparison, and he promises to appoint justices that are “fair, well experienced and put politics aside”.</h4>
			
			<h4>As we approach the end of the debate, we find ourselves at the national budget question. Both candidates promise to cut defense spending, which I am not in favor of. For our nation to be safe, it’s important that our army be so overwhelming that no one would even consider going to war with us. I don’t agree with raising the defense spending anytime soon, but it should not be lowered.</h4>
			
			<h4>As the debate is wrapped up, Kaidon reiterates his goal to invest in the middle class and make college and healthcare free or affordable, while GodofPolitics wishes to make policy to help main street, not wall street.</h4>
			
			<h4>After reading this debate, I wasn’t thrilled with either candidate, though I leaned in Kaidon’s camp. However, something I hadn’t considered at the time were the VP picks. It’s important to keep in mind, a vote for Kaidon or GodofPolitics is also a vote for Nicholas Richardson and Cameron Mills. While Cameron seems to be just as left as Kaidon and GodofPolitics, Nick appears to be a down to earth, moderate, right wing candidate. I haven’t talked with him much, but every time I have, he’s impressed me. With this in mind, I’m firmly in the Kaidon/Nick camp and I’ll be happy to vote for them on election day; and, while I look forward to tonight’s presidential debate, I find myself looking forward to the VP debate even more.</h4>
