			<h4>As of yesterday, the server is now running under a new, role-play money system. Every day, you will be given a salary based on your role in the government, which you can use to pay for media subscriptions, housing, new businesses, media advertising, etc. The Right Wing Network talked with Franklin Hudson today, the moderator who was in charge of setting up this system, to help clarify what you need to know regarding this new change.</h4>
			
			<h4><b>Is tax automatically deducted from our daily salary? </b>Yes, tax has already been calculated and your salary will be given to you pre-taxed.</h4>
			
			<h4><b>How can we pay money from one person to another, and will that money be taxed? </b>You can pay money to other people, but all transactions must be audited, and your transactions with other players will be taxed.</h4>
			
			<h4><b>Will the bank pay interest? </b>The !bank command will not pay interest, but player-run banks <i>can</i> pay interest if they so choose.</h4>
			
			<h4>This recent change will definitely give a harder impact to the <a href="../../../../../articles/2020/7/22/new-tax-legislation-passed/index.html">Revenue Act of 2021,</a> as the tax codes outlined in that law will now directly affect the players and corporations in this server. If you would like to support RWN, <a href="../../../../../rent-an-ad.html">please consider renting ad-space,</a> as it helps keep the site going.</h4>
