			<h3 class="container-title">Automating this Website</h3>

			<h4>As I continue to archive sessions and write new articles, I find that it's taking up a rather large portion of my time. That was fine when this website was new and exciting, and taking an hour to create an archive page was tolerable, but I can't continue like this. It's simply unfeasible to commit this much time to maintaining the site.</h4>
			
			<h4>This is why I am in the process of writing a Java program to begin the automation of this site. <a href="house7-19-2020.html">My most recent archive</a> was generated using this program. I copy and pasted the chat logs from the discord channel, put them into an HTML file, hand typed some metadata into the same file (information about who was speaking and what party they belonged to), then I ran the program and it gave me a webpage. From there, I made some tweaks to it and uploaded it.</h4>
			
			<h4>The process is far from perfect: as it stands right now, I think I spent <i>more</i> time using this method than I would've if I just manually wrote the HTML page myself, but I believe it's a step in the right direction. I will continue work on it in hopes that, some day, it'll become a 1 minute process of copy and pasting from a channel, pressing a button, and having an entire hour long session automagically archived. Once I'm done with that, then I can move on to more fascinating things, like turning this into a proper media website.</h4>
