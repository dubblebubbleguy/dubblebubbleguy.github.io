			<h3>How to Rent Advertising Space</h3>
			<h4>Renting advertising space on the Right Wing Network is simple and affordable! Before submitting your ad, please be sure it follows the specifications below:</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>&#x25BA;It must be an image or GIF that's 330 pixels wide and 1060 pixels tall (330x1060)</h4></li>
				<li><h4>&#x25BA;It must be appropriate for a PG-13 audience</h4></li>
				<li><h4>&#x25BA;If a hyper link is provided for the ad, the link must point to a PG-13 appropriate site.</h4></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Once your ad fits the above criteria, you may select a pricing plan for it from one of the plans below. (All plans are priced in roleplay-dollars, no plan costs USD or Robux)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Affordable plan 800$/day &#x25BA;Your ad will run at a normal priority level. All ads at this level <i>must</i> be still images, no GIFs are allowed.</h4></li>
				<li><h4>Premium plan 1200$/day &#x25BA;Your ad is more likely to be shown than at the affordable level. GIFs are allowed.</h4></li>
				<li><h4>Campaign plan 1600$/day &#x25BA;Your ad is very likely to be shown compared to premium and affordable ads. GIFs are allowed.</h4></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Once your ad is ready and you've picked your pricing plan, send a DM to dubblebubbleguy#8460. Once your ad has been approved, you can send your first payment to dubblebubbleguy to begin your ad campaign. You may stop your campaign at any time by ceasing payments, but if you wish to restart it at a later date, please contact dubblebubbleguy.</h4>
			<h4>Please take note, at the time of writing, ads are only being shown on articles. Ads are also not currently being shown on mobile devices. This may change in the future.</h4>
